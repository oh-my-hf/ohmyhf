 * Phase E: local-toolchain integrations (export to Ollama / LM Studio / ComfyUI),
 * upload workflow, and the inference playground backend.

 * Result/progress messages travel as i18n keys in the renderer's `integrations`
 * namespace so every surface stays localized. Implementations live under
 * `./integrations/`; this facade keeps the wiring surface for ipc.ts stable.
